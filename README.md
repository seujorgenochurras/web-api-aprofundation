# web-api-aprofundation
I may know something about code, but I still strugle when it comes to web API stuff<br><br>
I'll use this repo to save a lot of random API stuff, if this goes according to plan, I want to learn:<br>
  - non-sql databases
  - RPC stuff (specially gRPC)
  - Explore python web API making
  - Improve my restful APIs code quality
  - API testing (stuff like end-to-end, unit testing)
  - And learn about good API and code documentation
